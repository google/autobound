"""A library for editing computation graphs.

This library offers more limited functionality than dedicated pattern-matching
libraries like matchpy (https://github.com/HPAC/matchpy).  However, unlike
matchpy and many other existing libraries, it works directly on computation
graphs rather than on trees.  This makes it easier to handle certain use cases,
like editing Jaxprs.
